% test script for calculating the dispersion center based on the PSF elongation of 2 or more spots.

% first read in the test data

% user interactive spot selection input will be N spots (modes)

% refine the co-ordinate positions by centroiding

% construnct line equation values between the two spots (i.e. m and c)

% repeat for all spots

% calculate the median of intercepts this is the dispersion center, can test on both
